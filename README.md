This is a frontend-only prototype to illustrate how a scavenger hunt app could look!

This is part of a group project responding to the brief of creating something that could help people form bonds quickly in a new team.

The idea is that team members would pair up and move around the building - at each location, a QR code would reveal a conversation prompt to help them get to know their teammate better. Once an answer is submitted, an alert (which would be much more stylish than this one) would reveal the location of the next clue.

We also want to consider ways in which this task could be implemented remotely.
